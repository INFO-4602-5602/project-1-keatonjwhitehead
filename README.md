For this project I did not do any bells and whistles. I had a Test to study for
and other homework to finish and was on a very strict timeline. I did have a lot
of trouble but I worked with Matt Coker and we tweaked some of the small errors
out. I did have to look up many things as I am completely new to this and my sources
are listed below. I was not able to submit my code on time because I was out at class
all day and I did not realize I did not push up my most recent code so that is why
it is late. I did finish it on time I just forgot I had to push it up to GitHub :/
